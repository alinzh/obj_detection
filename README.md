## Road-detection: detection of traffic signs and potholes by ML-models
Implementation of detection by transfer learning with popular Yolo8 and models from Detectrons zoo. Training takes place on a custom dataset assembled from several.

The dataset includes 157 classes:
- 156 - different types of Russian traffic signs
- 1 - potholes

The repository contains a script for assembling datasets and bringing them to required annotation format.

Both datasets are available at the following links:
